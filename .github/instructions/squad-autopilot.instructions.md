# Squad Autopilot Conventions

These conventions define `mode=autopilot`: a full delivery pipeline the Squad Coordinator runs end-to-end on the user's behalf. Autopilot sequences the squad's normal roles — research, then planning, then implementation, then review — without pausing for a human at every stage. It pauses **only** at the two places that matter: any impactful or irreversible action, and the final outcome.

Autopilot exists so the squad earns its keep. If a human had to approve every intermediate step, there would be no reason to run a squad over the individual HVE Core agents. Autopilot delegates the *flow* to the coordinator while keeping the *consequential decisions* with the human.

## Relationship to the Other Modes

The squad has three operating modes. They are selected per turn through the `/squad` prompt's `mode` input.

| Mode                     | Opt-in              | Who approves what                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Interactive (default)    | no `mode` flag      | The human approves **each stage** (research, plan, implement, review). A notification fires at every stage gate.    |
| `mode=autonomous`        | `mode=autonomous`   | A narrow validator loop: the council re-validates a single implementer output (max 2 cycles). See `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autonomous.instructions.md`. |
| `mode=autopilot`         | `mode=autopilot`    | The human approves **only** impactful actions and the **final outcome**. Everything in between runs autonomously.   |

Autopilot is the higher-level orchestration; `mode=autonomous` is one component it reuses at the implementation stage. Setting `mode=autopilot` does not require also setting `mode=autonomous`.

## Opt-In Surface

The single opt-in is the `/squad` prompt input `mode=autopilot`. When the input is present:

* The coordinator runs the Pipeline Contract below across the matched work instead of the normal single-pattern, single-turn classification.
* The coordinator records the opt-in through the Squad Scribe so the autopilot-run history file (see History Entries) carries the per-run opt-in evidence.

When the input is absent, the coordinator runs the normal interactive per-turn protocol from `.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, where each routed stage is gated by its routing autonomy tier.

## Pipeline Contract

Autopilot runs the squad's roles as an ordered pipeline. Each stage dispatches the roles that own it (resolved through `team.md`), waits for their findings, hands the outcome to the Scribe, and advances to the next stage without a human turn — except where a Human Gate (below) fires.

**Precondition — the squad must be built first.** Before the Research stage runs, a confirmed squad must exist: `.copilot-tracking/squad/team.md` and `routing.md` are present. When they are missing, the coordinator runs Init Mode (propose → confirm → create) from `.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md` to completion — including the user's profile confirmation — and only then enters the pipeline. Autopilot never auto-seeds the roster or starts Research without a built squad; the opt-in sequences the work, it does not waive the build.

1. **Research.** Dispatch the `researcher` role (and any parallel-eligible read-only roles the request matches) at `auto` tier. Gather findings; no human gate.
2. **Plan.** Dispatch the `lead` role to produce the implementation plan. In autopilot the plan does not pause for per-step human confirmation; the coordinator advances once the plan is recorded through the Scribe.
3. **Pre-implementation council.** When the work crosses two or more council-member domains (architecture, security, cost, product-fit, RAI), run the council per `.github/instructions/squad/squad-council.instructions.md` before any implementation dispatch. A `Stop` verdict fires a Human Gate. A `Go` or `Go-With-Conditions` verdict permits the implementation stage with the conditions attached as inputs.
4. **Implement.** Dispatch the `developer` role. The implementation stage runs the bounded validator loop from `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autonomous.instructions.md` (council re-validation, max two cycles, divergence detection) so the build self-validates before review. Any action the implementer cannot self-validate — and every impactful action — fires a Human Gate rather than proceeding.
5. **Review.** Dispatch the `tester` role at `auto` tier against the implemented changes. Record the review outcome through the Scribe.
6. **Final-outcome validation.** Autopilot never auto-releases. After review, the coordinator compiles the run outcome and fires a final-outcome notification to the registered user per `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`, then waits for human validation before any release-tier action.

The coordinator advances stage-to-stage by reading the prior stage's findings; it hands every stage transition to the Scribe, which records it in the autopilot-run history file and updates `state.json`.

## Artifact Gates (Evidence Required)

Each pipeline stage is gated on the prior stage's artifact existing on disk. The coordinator confirms the evidence before advancing; a stage with no artifact and no `history/<agent>.md` entry did not run, and the pipeline cannot skip it. This is what makes the methodology auditable rather than assumed.

| Stage     | Mapped role(s)                                                                  | Must produce                              | Cannot start until                                     |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| research  | `researcher`                                                                   | `.copilot-tracking/research/<date>/*.md`  | request classified                                     |
| plan      | `lead`                                                                          | `.copilot-tracking/plans/*.md`            | a research artifact exists                             |
| council   | `architect`, `security`, `cost-manager`, `product-owner` (+`rai` when relevant) | a `## Council Verdict` in `decisions.md`  | a plan artifact exists                                 |
| implement | `developer`                                                                    | `.copilot-tracking/changes/*`             | a plan artifact and a non-`Stop` Council Verdict exist |
| review    | `tester`                                                                       | a review record + `history/<agent>.md`    | implementation changes exist                           |

When a required artifact is missing, the coordinator dispatches the owning agent to produce it — it never authors the artifact itself and never advances on assumed completion. When the owning agent is not installed, the coordinator stops and escalates per *Dispatch Discipline* in `.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`.

## Human Gates

Human Gates are the only points where autopilot stops and hands control to the human. They are deliberately narrow. A gate stops the pipeline, fires a notification per `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`, and waits for explicit human approval through the configured approval channel before the gated action proceeds.

When the approval channel is `github-issue`, the gate is approvable **remotely from a phone**: the human receives a GitHub mobile push and replies with `/approve`, `/changes: <note>`, or `/stop` from the issue. This is what lets an unattended run on a VM advance through its gates while the human is away from the machine. The squad persists the pending gate in `state.json` and proceeds only when an authorized approval returns — never on a timeout.

Two gate classes exist.

### Impactful-Action Gate

Before performing any impactful or irreversible action, autopilot stops and requires explicit human approval for that specific action. This reuses the **Mandatory Escalation Triggers** from `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autonomous.instructions.md`. Gated actions include, at minimum:

* Any deployment to Azure or any other environment (production or otherwise) the project has not marked safe.
* Any `git push`, and any force-push to any branch.
* Any pull-request merge.
* Schema migrations, data deletions, and other destructive data operations.
* Destructive infrastructure operations such as `terraform apply -auto-approve` or `az` deletes.
* Secret or credential rotation.
* Any side effect the user has marked irreversible for the project.

The gate is per-action: autopilot may complete all non-impactful work and stop precisely at the impactful step, presenting the human with exactly what is about to happen and why.

### Risk Gate

Autopilot also stops, regardless of pipeline stage, on any of these — identical to the autonomous loop's mandatory triggers so the two modes never disagree:

* Any `Stop` verdict from the council or any individual council role.
* Any `Risk: High` finding from `security`, `cost-manager`, or `rai`.
* Any cost-impacting move the `cost-manager` flags at `confirm` tier.
* Any compliance violation flagged by `rai` or `security` (regulated-data handling, PII leakage, GDPR/HIPAA scope).
* Divergence: two consecutive validator cycles producing different verdicts on the same issue.
* The configured per-turn cost ceiling (`cost-ceiling=$X`) would be exceeded by the next stage or cycle.

A single qualifying trigger is enough to fire the gate, no matter how many other findings are clean.

## What Autopilot Does Not Do

* It does not stop for human confirmation at every stage. Research, planning, implementation, and review flow automatically between gates.
* It does not perform any impactful action without explicit human approval at the Impactful-Action Gate.
* It does not auto-release: the final outcome always returns to the human for validation before deploy, push, or merge.
* It does not downgrade a `confirm`-tier action to `auto`. Autopilot changes *who sequences the work*, not *which actions need a human*.

## Final-Outcome Validation

When the pipeline reaches Final-outcome validation:

1. The coordinator compiles a concise outcome: what the squad built, the review result, any conditions left open, and the impactful actions awaiting approval (if any).
2. The coordinator fires a `final-outcome` notification to the registered approval channel through `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`. When the channel is `github-issue`, the human can validate the outcome from a phone. When no channel is configured, or no transport is available, the notification degrades to an in-chat summary and is still logged.
3. The coordinator waits for human validation. The human may approve (releasing the gated impactful actions one by one), request changes (re-entering the pipeline at the appropriate stage), or stop.

## History Entries

Every autopilot run produces history the Squad Scribe writes (the single-writer rule from `.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md` still holds):

1. **Per-agent history.** Each dispatched role adds its normal entry to `.copilot-tracking/squad/history/<agent>.md`, plus the autopilot run id and stage so the run is reconstructable.
2. **Autopilot-run summary.** The coordinator hands the Scribe one summary payload per run. The Scribe writes it to `.copilot-tracking/squad/history/autopilot-run-<id>.md`, where `<id>` is the run topic-id slug. The summary uses this shape:

```markdown
---
description: "Autopilot-run summary for topic <id>"
---

# Autopilot Run: <id>

* Topic: <one-line summary>
* Opt-In: mode=autopilot
* Cost Ceiling: <value or unset>
* Outcome: completed (awaiting final validation) | escalated (<reason>) | stopped (<reason>)

## Gates and Approvals

| Timestamp | Gate                 | Awaiting / Resolved By        | Notes                  |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| <ts>      | <Impactful / Risk / Final> | <human decision or pending> | <one-line>             |
```

The autopilot-run file is append-only by topic-id; one file per run topic. Re-running the same topic appends a new dated `## Stages` section rather than overwriting.
